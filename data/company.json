        "description": "I have very personally felt the overwhelming loneliness, self-doubt, and frustration that often comes with the minority status of a woman in engineering. As much as I can help others get through or avoid those difficult stretches that I myself had to weather, I'd like to. As a bonus, the more women (and minorities) that enter and don’t leave the field, the better it all gets for everyone, including me! - Tracy Chou",

Female COO, female pilot, female surgeon — as if the gender implies surprise … One day there won’t be female leaders. There will just be leaders. Sheryl Sandberg studied at Harvard University and is the chief operating officer of Facebook and became the first woman on Facebook’s board of directors. She is an author and billionaire and was named on the Time’s 100 most influential people list in 2012.",

Being a Black woman, being a woman in general, on a team of all men, means that you are going to have a unique voice. It’s important to embrace that. Erin Teague began as a software engineer for Morgan Stanley and has gone on to work for YouTube, developing its Virtual and Augmented Reality products.

Rarely are opportunities presented to you in the perfect way, in a nice little box with a yellow bow on top. Opportunities, the good ones, they’re messy and confusing and hard to recognize. They’re risky. They challenge you. Susan Wojcicki had an incredible career, from being involved in the founding of Google in 1999 and becoming the CEO of YouTube in 2014. Her net worth is nearly $500 million and she’s an advocate for extending paid family leave and opposing gender discrimination in tech companies.",
